Hello, my name is **Alondra**! I'm currently a college senior double majoring in computer science and philosophy. 

My main goal is to not only continuously learn about new technologies while exploring their potential and developing new skills, but also assess their ethical implications. I am driven by a commitment to ensure that the innovations I contribute have a positive and meaningful impact on society. 

Within technology, some other interests I enjoy working with / would like to learn more about include web development, mobile development, AI, and game development. 

Thanks for reading!
