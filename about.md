Hello! I'm currently a college junior double majoring in computer science and philosophy. I find that this combination of studies captures my interest within technology and its ethical implications.

My main goal is to not only continously learn about new technologies while exploring their potential and developing new skills, but critically assess their ethical implications. I am driven by a commitment to ensure that the innovations I contribute to have a positive and meaningful impact on society. 

Within technology, some other interests I enjoy working with / would like to learn more about include: web / app development, AI, and game development.
