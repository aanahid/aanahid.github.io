Hello! I'm currently a college junior double majoring in computer science and philosophy. I find that this combination of studies captures my interest in technology and its ethical implications.

My main goal is to not only continuously learn about new technologies while exploring their potential and developing new skills, but critically assess their ethical implications. I am driven by a commitment to ensure that the innovations I contribute have a positive and meaningful impact on society. 

Within technology, some other interests I enjoy working with / would like to learn more about include web / app development, AI, and game development.
