Stardew Valley pet texture replacement mod with 100+ unique downloads. 

<img src="/images/mod-resize.png" alt="Lark's Mod in-game">

## Overview
Stardew Valley is a farming life simulation game. This mod allows players to replace the texture of an original pet option with a texture of dog that resembles my dog. 

## Development
Changes to the existing textures are defined in JSON files and used with [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915), a separate mod that loads content packs that changes the game's data, images, and maps without replacing XNB files. Sprites created using [Clip Studio Paint](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/).

Available for download on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/17889).

## Further Thoughts
This is not only my first Stardew Valley mod, but also my first mod for any game. The large modding community for Stardew Valley has a variety of resources which I used while making my mod. Issues I ran into were resolved by looking at these resources.
