Collect acorns, time travel, and save the squirrel! 

## Overview
"In Your Darkest Hour" is a 2D platformer game created using Godot 4 that embarks players on a daring adventure to rescue a squirrel in danger. Navigate a perilous world filled with obstacles while collecting acorns to save your furry friend. Be sure to use your "Double Take" time travel ability, allowing you to rewind your position by five seconds. Use this unique power strategically to be the squirrel's hero.

## Development 
I worked with fellow members of UNC's Game Development Club to create this game for the 2023 North Carolina Collegiate Game Jam. We utilized Godot 4, a game development engine to create this 2D platformer. "In Your Darkest Hour" features pixel art created by myself and my teammates using Clip Studio Paint and Aesprite. I curated 3 original music tracks and various sound effects that were all made using LMMS. 

Additionally, I successfully contributed to level design, main menu design, and story writing. I utilized GDScript for backend game mechanics. For collaboration we used GitHub. 

The game is available to play here. Have fun! 

## Further Thoughts
This was the first game I worked on using Godot. It was most rewarding to see other club members play and enjoy our game. Aside from the game development skills I learned, the process of working with teammates allowed me to improve my ability to work with a team and communicate with others.
