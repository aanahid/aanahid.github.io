Digital collection of projects that demonstrate my skills, creativity, and passion for technology.

## Overview
If you're reading this, then you are already looking at my online portfolio. I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator powered by Ruby. This allowed me to efficiently customize and generate the site's content. On the frontend, I utilized HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and SCSS to enhance maintainability in the stylesheets. For hosting, I used GitHub Pages.

## Development
This was my first time using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, however I was able to utilize both to create and host my site. I decided to use the Jekyll theme, [Celeste](https://github.com/nicoelayda/celeste) by [@nicoelayda](https://github.com/nicoelayda). From there, I was able to modify and expand upon the HTML, CSS, and SCSS code for customization and adding elements such as an original home button, photos, and links.
Aside from the homepage, I have an about page which provides some information about my background and intersts. Additionally, I added a works page which lists projects I have worked on. Each project features a detailed overview along with additional information. 

## Further Thoughts
My main goal by putting together this online portfolio was to not only futher improve my web development skills, but also have a collection of all my projects in one place. I also find this is a great way for others to learn more about me, my interests, and projects I have dedicated time and effort towards. 
Hopefully after exploring my website you'll know a bit more about me than you did before.
